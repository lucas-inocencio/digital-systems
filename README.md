# Digital-Systems

This is a collection of VHDL implementations of digital circuits, some of which have been tested on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA).

The code here is based on Circuit Design with VHDL by Volnei Pedroni, Sistemas Digitais by Ronald Tocci, and Sistemas Digitais by Thomas Floyd.
